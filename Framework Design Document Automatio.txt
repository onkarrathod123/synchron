Framework Design Document: Automation Framework for IPL Stats

Introduction:
The Automation Framework for IPL Stats is designed to automate the testing process of the IPL Stats page, enabling efficient and reliable validation of various areas and functionalities. This document outlines the design principles, architecture, and guidelines for developing the automation framework.

Goals and Objectives:

Provide an automated testing solution for the IPL Stats page.
Ensure accurate and reliable validation of key areas and functionalities.
Increase testing efficiency and reduce manual effort.
Facilitate easy maintenance and scalability of the automation framework.
Architecture:
The automation framework will follow a modular and layered architecture, consisting of the following components:
a) Test Automation Core: This component forms the core of the framework and includes the automation engine responsible for executing tests, interacting with the IPL Stats page, and generating test reports.

b) Test Data Management: This component manages the test data required for executing test cases. It includes data repositories and utilities for data retrieval, creation, and modification.

c) Test Case Management: This component includes utilities for organizing and managing test cases. It provides functionalities for test case creation, categorization, and execution control.

d) Test Reporting: This component generates detailed and concise reports for test execution results. It includes customizable reporting templates and integration with popular reporting tools.

e) Configuration Management: This component manages the configuration settings required for the automation framework, such as the IPL Stats page URL, browser preferences, and test environment configurations.

f) Logging and Debugging: This component provides logging and debugging capabilities for better troubleshooting and error analysis during test execution.

Design Principles:
The following design principles should be followed during the development of the automation framework:
a) Modularity: The framework should be modular to allow easy maintenance, scalability, and reusability of code components.

b) Extensibility: The framework should support easy integration with new features, libraries, and tools for future enhancements.

c) Test Data Separation: Test data should be separated from the test cases, enabling flexibility in data management and reducing redundancy.

d) Test Case Reusability: Test cases should be designed to be reusable across different scenarios, reducing the effort required for maintenance.

e) Error Handling and Reporting: The framework should handle errors gracefully and provide detailed error reporting for effective debugging.

Automation Framework Design:
The automation framework will be developed using the following components and technologies:
a) Programming Language: [Specify the programming language of choice]

b) Test Framework: [Specify the test framework/library of choice]

c) Browser Automation: [Specify the browser automation tool/library of choice]

d) Test Data Management: [Specify the approach/tool for managing test data]
